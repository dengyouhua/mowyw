mowyw (0.4.0)
	* mowyw: Added support for new delimiters: [% ... %] instead of [[[

	* example/source/foo2.shtml: added example [% ... %] tags
mowyw (0.3.0)

	* README: update accordingly
	* example/source/bar.shtml: added syntax hilighting example
	* example/source/style.css: added syntax hilighting classes
	* Mowyw/Lexer.pm: fixed handling of "0" string
mowyw (0.2.0) 
	* Mowyw/Lexer.pm: added a separate lexer
	* mowyw: (nearly) complete rewrite using a recursive-descending parser

	stuff)[[[endverbatim foo]]]
